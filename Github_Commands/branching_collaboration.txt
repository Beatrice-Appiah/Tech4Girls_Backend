Branching in a very powerful feature that allows developers to create parallel lines of development, enabling, them to work on experiments or
without affecting the main codebase.
This ensures that changes are isolated from the main branch and can be merged whenever the user or collaborators are ready.
Benefits of collaborating:
a. Isolation: Changes made on a branch don't affect the main codebase until they are merged. This prevents accidental overwrites and makes it easier to manage different features or bug fixes.
b. Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on different branches simultaneously, each focusing on their own tasks without interfering with others.
c. Experimentation: Developers can experiment with new ideas or features on a separate branch without risking the stability of the main branch.
