# ASSIGNMENT: INTRODUCTION TO DATABASES AND SQL
Think of a database as an organized collection of information.
A  database can be accessed by the backend codes to retrieve, update and delete data, helping the efficency of applications.
Databases can store information in fields,records,relationships and tables.
It's like a digital filing cabinet, but much more powerful. Instead of paper files, it stores data electronically, making it accessible and searchable.

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful programming language(query language)designed to manage and manipulate data within relational databases. It allows you to perform a wide range of operations, from simple data retrieval to complex data analysis.
Some commands to manipulate data are: CREATE TABLE(creates a new table), ALTER TABLE(modifies an existing table;add, drop, or modify columns), DROP TABLE(deletes a table), SELECT(retrieves data from one or more tables).

There are many Database Management Systems,but the focus now is in MySQL.
MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system  used to store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently. It's a key component of many web applications, from small personal projects to large-scale enterprise systems. Some of its key features are reliability, flexibility, performance, security sensitive,etc.

## ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW
This directory files of conatins SQL codes as answers to an assignment to acquire more understanding and proficiency with SQL and Databases(Relational Databases). This assignment is to help understand the basic of mySQL and how to manipulate data. This assignment includes;
- Creating a Database
- Using the Database
- Creating Tables in the Database
- Inserting Values(data) into the fields and records
- Creating relationships(one-many, many-to-many) between these tables in the database


## HOW TO USE THIS DIRECTORY
```bash
  #Clone the repository to your local machine.
  git clone https://github.com/Beatrice-Appiah/Tech4Girls_Backend.git

  #Navigate to the directory where you cloned it.
  cd SQL_Assignment 

  #Run the provided SQL scripts in your terminal.
  - Enter your local sql terminal
   mysql -u -root -p 

  #Then follow the prompts in each script to interact with the programs.
```


## OVERVIEW OF FILES
This directory contains assignmnet answers in three files. They are;
* question1.sql: Creating a database and creating a table within, then inserting data values in the table.
* question2.sql: Using the database in 'question1.sql', creating more tables, creating relationships between the tables(one-to-many).
* question3.sql: Using the database in 'question1.sql', creating more tables, creating more relationships between tables in question1.sql(many-to-many).
