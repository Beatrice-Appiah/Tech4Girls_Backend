-- Brief explanation of Object Oriented Programming: 
OOP is a programming criteria that treats problems such as a collection of objects,
each with their own attributes and methods. Enhacing reusability and organiztion 
of codes.
These principles allow developers create modular and well-structured codes by
defining tje relationship between objects and managing the access to their
internal details.

The four main Principles of OOP are:
a. Encapsulation:
The practice of bundling data (attributes) and methods together within a class, restricting direct access to data and
only allowing modifications through defined methods, protecting the internal state of an object. 

b. Abstraction:
Focuses on the essential features of an object, hiding unnecessary implementation details and presenting a
simplified interface to interact with it.

c. Inheritance:
Allows a new class (child class) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (parent class), enabling code reuse and
creating hierarchical relationships between classes.

d. Polymorphism:
The ability of an object to take on multiple forms, allowing the same method name to perform
different actions depending on the object type.


-- Why OOP is beneficial for Software Development?
It is important because:
i. Improves collaboration: OOP provides a standardized approach that allows developers
to work independently on different components. 

ii. Reduces code duplication: OOP allows developers to break down complex systems
into smaller, more manageable objects. 

iii. Saves development time: OOP allows developers to reuse code and combine
existing libraries. 

Makes code more readable and maintainable: OOP uses modularity and encapsulation
to improve code organization. 


-- Real_life examples;
a. The technicalities of how are car accelerates and modulates are hidden
in methods to make it easier to read.

b. A human can be a class with different methods and attributes and also 
take different forms.

c. An animals can be a class with different methods and attributes and also
have different types of animals(instances).
